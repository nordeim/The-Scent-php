Great! At 2025-04-02 04:44:25, all caches have been successfully cleared and rebuilt. The output shows everything is working correctly:

✅ Cache Operations Completed:
1. `view:clear` - Views cache cleared
2. `route:clear` - Route cache cleared
3. `config:clear` - Configuration cache cleared
4. `cache:clear` - Application cache cleared

✅ Optimization Results:
1. `config` - Done in 9.23ms
2. `events` - Done in 2.88ms
3. `routes` - Done in 12.11ms
4. `views` - Done in 25.73ms

Now that the caches are rebuilt, let's verify the application is working:

```bash
# Check if the application is serving correctly
php artisan serve

# Verify routes are registered
php artisan route:list

# Check storage directory permissions
ls -la storage/
ls -la bootstrap/cache/
```

Would you like me to:
1. Help test if the routes are working correctly?
2. Show how to verify the views are being loaded?
3. Guide you through checking the application in a browser?

Also, I notice you're logged in as `nordeim` but running commands as `www-data`. Would you like me to help set up the correct permissions for development?
