Great! The installation was successful with Laravel 12 and all compatible packages. The package discovery process completed successfully as well.

Now you'll need to update your code to work with the new package versions. Here are the main changes you'll need to make:

1. For sluggable (changed from cviebrock to spatie):
```php
// Before (cviebrock/eloquent-sluggable)
use Cviebrock\EloquentSluggable\Sluggable;

class YourModel extends Model
{
    use Sluggable;

    public function sluggable(): array
    {
        return [
            'slug' => [
                'source' => 'name'
            ]
        ];
    }
}

// After (spatie/laravel-sluggable)
use Spatie\Sluggable\HasSlug;
use Spatie\Sluggable\SlugOptions;

class YourModel extends Model
{
    use HasSlug;

    public function getSlugOptions(): SlugOptions
    {
        return SlugOptions::create()
            ->generateSlugsFrom('name')
            ->saveSlugsTo('slug');
    }
}
```

2. For Intervention Image v3:
```php
// Before (v2)
$image = Image::make('path/to/image.jpg');
$image->resize(300, 200);

// After (v3)
use Intervention\Image\ImageManager;
use Intervention\Image\Drivers\Gd\Driver;

$manager = new ImageManager(new Driver());
$image = $manager->read('path/to/image.jpg');
$image->resize(height: 200, width: 300);
$image->save('path/to/new/image.jpg');
```

3. Laravel 12's new configuration style in bootstrap/app.php (which you already have):
```php
return Application::configure(basePath: dirname(__DIR__))
    ->withRouting(
        web: __DIR__.'/../routes/web.php',
        commands: __DIR__.'/../routes/console.php',
        health: '/up',
    )
    ->withMiddleware(function (Middleware $middleware) {
        //
    })
    ->withExceptions(function (Exceptions $exceptions) {
        //
    })->create();
```

4. Update any Sanctum usage for v4:
```php
// Before
use Laravel\Sanctum\HasApiTokens;

// After - same trait, but might need to update token creation
$token = $user->createToken('token-name', ['abilities' => ['server:update']]);
```

5. Check your routes/web.php and routes/api.php files as Laravel 12 has some routing changes:
```php
// New syntax available (optional)
Route::prefix('/api/v1')->group(function () {
    Route::get('/users', UsersController::class)->name('users.index');
})->middleware('api');
```

Would you like me to help you with any specific part of the upgrade process or show examples for other components you're using?
