# First install/update dependencies
# Clear NPM cache if needed
npm cache clean --force

# Clear node_modules and lock files to ensure clean state
rm -rf node_modules package-lock.json
npm install

rm -rf vendor composer.lock
composer install

# Build frontend assets
npm run build

# Clear all Laravel caches as you mentioned
php artisan cache:clear
php artisan config:clear
php artisan route:clear
php artisan view:clear
php artisan optimize:clear

# Rebuild autoloader
composer dump-autoload

# Link storage
php artisan storage:link

# Optional but recommended for production
php artisan optimize
php artisan view:cache
php artisan config:cache

# If using route model binding
php artisan route:cache
```

Based on the Laravel project structure and the HTML output, the main landing page is composed of several key files:

1. **Layout Template**:
```bash
resources/views/layouts/app.blade.php
```
This is the main layout template that provides the basic structure (header, navigation, footer).

2. **Homepage View**:
```bash
resources/views/welcome.blade.php
# or
resources/views/home.blade.php
```
This contains the specific content for the landing page.

3. **Route Definition** (likely in):
```bash
routes/web.php
```
This defines what controller/view handles the '/' (root) URL.

Let's check these files:

```bash
# View the route definition
cat routes/web.php

# View the layout template
cat resources/views/layouts/app.blade.php

# View the homepage view
cat resources/views/welcome.blade.php
# or
cat resources/views/home.blade.php
```

The structure we're seeing in the browser shows:
1. Navigation bar with:
   - Logo ("Aromatherapy Store")
   - Menu items ("Products", "Shop by Mood", "Scent Profiles")
   - Cart icon
2. Main content area with:
   - "Welcome to Aromatherapy Store" heading
3. Footer with:
   - Shop links
   - Newsletter subscription form
   - Copyright notice

Would you like me to:
1. Show you how to modify specific parts of the landing page?
2. Explain how the blade template system works?
3. Help you customize the design?
