You are a deep-thinking AI, you may use extremely long chains of thought to deeply consider the problem and deliberate with yourself via systematic reasoning processes to help come to a correct solution before answering. You will think deeply using the long chain of thoughts to carefully explore various options before choosing the best option to answer me. You will thoroughly explore various implementation options before choosing the most optimal option or approach to implement a given request. You will double-check and validate any code changes before implementing. You should enclose your thoughts and internal monologue inside <think> </think> tags, and then provide your solution or response to the problem.

Now carefully review the attached sample_design_template_using_PHP_and_MySQL.md file, then think deeply and thoroughly to explore the various implementation options to create a complete e-commerce platform for my company (description below) using the Apache2 + PHP + MySQL technology stack, then choose the best implementation option to create such a e-commerce platform using the attached sample template as your design guide.

Now you have to first carefully review and analyze all the existing project files in the "app" and "database" subfolders of the current project folder to understand the current state of the implementation before you continue with the implemention of a hybrid solution that builds upon the provided template while customizing it specifically for The Scent's needs. Here's the detailed implementation plan:

1. Database Structure:  
```
-- Enhance products table for aromatherapy specifics
ALTER TABLE products
ADD COLUMN product_type ENUM('essential_oil', 'soap') NOT NULL,
ADD COLUMN origin_country VARCHAR(100),
ADD COLUMN extraction_method VARCHAR(100),
ADD COLUMN botanical_name VARCHAR(255),
ADD COLUMN safety_notes TEXT,
ADD COLUMN usage_instructions TEXT,
ADD COLUMN shelf_life VARCHAR(50),
ADD COLUMN is_customizable BOOLEAN DEFAULT FALSE;

-- Add soap customization options
CREATE TABLE soap_customization_options (
    id INT UNSIGNED AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
    product_id INT UNSIGNED NOT NULL,
    option_name VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
    option_type ENUM('color', 'scent', 'size', 'shape') NOT NULL,
    price_adjustment DECIMAL(10,2) DEFAULT 0,
    FOREIGN KEY (product_id) REFERENCES products(id) ON DELETE CASCADE
);

-- Add essential oil properties
CREATE TABLE essential_oil_properties (
    id INT UNSIGNED AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
    product_id INT UNSIGNED NOT NULL,
    property_name VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
    property_value TEXT NOT NULL,
    FOREIGN KEY (product_id) REFERENCES products(id) ON DELETE CASCADE
);

-- Add international shipping zones
CREATE TABLE shipping_zones (
    id INT UNSIGNED AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
    name VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
    base_rate DECIMAL(10,2) NOT NULL,
    countries TEXT NOT NULL,
    estimated_days VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL
);
```

2. Key Features to Implement:
a) Product Customization System:  
```
// app/Services/SoapCustomizationService.php
class SoapCustomizationService
{
    public function getCustomizationOptions($productId)
    {
        return SoapCustomizationOption::where('product_id', $productId)
            ->groupBy('option_type')
            ->get();
    }
    
    public function calculateCustomPrice($productId, $options)
    {
        $basePrice = Product::find($productId)->price;
        $adjustments = SoapCustomizationOption::whereIn('id', $options)
            ->sum('price_adjustment');
            
        return $basePrice + $adjustments;
    }
}
```

b) Essential Oil Profile Display:  
```
// app/Http/Controllers/ProductController.php
public function show($slug)
{
    $product = Product::with([
        'essentialOilProperties',
        'scentProfiles',
        'moods',
        'reviews'
    ])->where('slug', $slug)->firstOrFail();
    
    return view('products.show', compact('product'));
}
```

3. Frontend Enhancements:  
a) Interactive Soap Customizer:  
```
// public/js/soap-customizer.js
class SoapCustomizer {
    constructor(productId) {
        this.productId = productId;
        this.options = {};
        this.basePrice = 0;
    }
    
    async initialize() {
        const response = await fetch(`/api/products/${this.productId}/customization-options`);
        const data = await response.json();
        this.options = data.options;
        this.basePrice = data.basePrice;
        this.renderCustomizer();
    }
    
    renderCustomizer() {
        // Render color picker
        this.renderColorPicker();
        // Render scent selector
        this.renderScentSelector();
        // Render size options
        this.renderSizeOptions();
        // Render shape selector
        this.renderShapeSelector();
        
        this.updatePrice();
    }
    
    updatePrice() {
        const totalPrice = this.calculateTotalPrice();
        document.getElementById('custom-price').textContent = 
            `$${totalPrice.toFixed(2)}`;
    }
}
```

4. Educational Content Integration:  
```
// app/Http/Controllers/EducationController.php
class EducationController extends Controller
{
    public function index()
    {
        $articles = Article::where('category', 'education')
            ->with(['tags', 'author'])
            ->latest()
            ->paginate(12);
            
        return view('education.index', compact('articles'));
    }
    
    public function show($slug)
    {
        $article = Article::where('slug', $slug)
            ->with(['tags', 'author', 'relatedArticles'])
            ->firstOrFail();
            
        return view('education.show', compact('article'));
    }
}
```

5. International Shipping Integration:  
```
// app/Services/ShippingService.php
class ShippingService
{
    public function calculateShipping($country, $weight)
    {
        $zone = ShippingZone::where('countries', 'LIKE', "%{$country}%")->first();

        if (!$zone) {
            throw new Exception('Country not supported for shipping');
        }

        $rate = $zone->base_rate;
        $weightRate = $this->calculateWeightRate($weight);

        return [
            'rate' => $rate + $weightRate,
            'estimated_days' => $zone->estimated_days,
            'zone' => $zone->name
        ];
    }
}
```

This implementation provides:
- A robust product management system for both essential oils and custom soaps
- Interactive product customization for soaps
- Detailed essential oil profiles and benefits
- Educational content about aromatherapy
- International shipping capabilities
- Multi-language support
- Secure payment processing
- Comprehensive order management
- Analytics and reporting tools

The solution maintains the professional look and feel of the template while adding specific features needed for The Scent's business model. It's scalable, maintainable, and provides a great user experience for customers worldwide.
Would you like me to elaborate on any specific aspect of this implementation or provide more detailed code for any particular feature?
