I've created all the necessary controllers for the aromatherapy e-commerce system. Here's a summary of what each controller does:
ProductController:
Manages product listings with filtering by mood, scent profile, and price range
Handles product creation, editing, and deletion
Manages product images and relationships with moods and scent profiles
Provides product recommendations based on moods and scent profiles
Includes search functionality
MoodController:
Manages mood profiles and their relationships with products
Handles CRUD operations for moods
Provides mood-based product recommendations
Shows related moods based on product associations
Includes featured moods functionality
ScentProfileController:
Manages scent profiles and their relationships with products
Handles CRUD operations for scent profiles
Provides scent-based product recommendations
Shows related scent profiles based on product associations
Includes featured scent profiles functionality
ArticleController:
Manages aromatherapy articles and blog posts
Handles article creation, editing, and deletion
Manages article tags and featured images
Provides article search functionality
Shows related articles based on tags
Includes featured articles functionality
ArticleTagController:
Manages tags for articles
Handles CRUD operations for tags
Shows articles associated with each tag
Provides popular tags functionality
Includes validation to prevent deletion of tags with associated articles
All controllers include:
Proper validation for input data
Relationship management
Image handling where applicable
Proper error handling
Success/error messages
Pagination where appropriate
Eager loading to prevent N+1 queries
Proper authorization checks (though middleware needs to be added)
Would you like me to create any additional controllers or add any specific functionality to the existing ones?
